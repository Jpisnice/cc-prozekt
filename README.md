#Note!
-Do not mess with all the files in root directory
-only the files in [Link to Folder](./public) are to be changed.rest all are initiialized by firebase
-the [Link to Document](./public/firestore.txt) document does not serve any real purpose rather than to give a basic idea of the collection & document structure**
-the [Link to Document](./public/payment.js) is not used as of yet
-[Link to Document](./public/firebase-config.js) was created for optimization and did not perform as expected,hence refrain from referencing it in any document.For now it is just kept to refer the project configuration.
