# Note!

**Do not mess with all the files in the root directory.**

- Only the files in [/public](./public) are to be changed. All others are initialized by Firebase.
- The [firestore.txt](./public/firestore.txt) document does not serve any real purpose other than to give a basic idea of the collection & document structure.
- The [payment.js](./public/payment.js) is not used as of yet.
- [firebase-config.js](./public/firebase-config.js) was created for optimization and did not perform as expected; hence, refrain from referencing it in any document. For now, it is just kept to refer the project configuration.
